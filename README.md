# Hi there 👋

I’m **George**, a self-taught developer who loves building, experimenting, and learning new things.  
I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving problems, and creating projects that actually *work*.  
Always curious, always improving. That’s the fun part of the journey.

### What I’m into
- Building and breaking things to understand how they work  
- Exploring open-source projects
- Chess, coding marathons, and power naps  

---

### Open Source
- **[Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals)** - contributed to project documentation  
- **[Mousam](https://github.com/amit9838/mousam)** - resolved forecast display issues and improved widget behavior  
- **[Skrub](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub)** - implemented a global float precision configuration for reports

I write code, break things, and sometimes… they even work.
